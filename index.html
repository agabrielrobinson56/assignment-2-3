    <h1>Landmark or Liability? West Park Presbyterian Faces Preservation Debate</h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: gray;">By Ajhada Gabriel., December 7, 2025, Upper West Side, Manhattan</p>
    <h2>Historic Upper West Side church confronts decades of deterioration and dwindling congregation as LPC hearing approaches on Dec. 9</h2>

    <!-- Story text with expert quote -->
    <p>Since its 2010 landmark designation, West Park Presbyterian Church has seen over 60 complaints to the Department of Buildings, highlighting decades of unsafe scaffolding, cracked masonry, and falling debris. Advocates argue the historic structure deserves restoration, while critics say maintenance burdens threaten the congregation’s survival.</p>

    <p>“The denial of the hardship would not necessarily save the building," Leaf said at the first October hearing since re-submitting the hardship letter. “But it would almost certainly mean the end of a storied 140-year-old congregation. The building would continue to decline until a buyer could be found and repairs could be made and the sidewalk bridge surrounding the building would likely remain in place for the foreseeable future.”</p>
